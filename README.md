The slot machin game lets a user spin the 3 slots by clicking the spin button. 
If the 3 images do not match, the bet amount is subtracted from the balance total. 
If the balance total is 0, the user loses and cannot spin again.

If the user wins, the balance is increased by 3x the bet amount. 
The bet amount of 3 increases the balance by 45 each win.
